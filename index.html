              <h2>THE BEGINNING OF US !!!</h2>
              <p>I honestly didn’t know anyone was watching me that day. However, my first impression of Doro was: Who really is this guy?!</p>
              <p>It was the second day of the I-Soar conference. I arrived late to the service but danced and rejoiced my way into the canopy. The weather suddenly changed, and I slipped in quickly to be safe.</p>
              <p>There stood a guy separate from the rest of us he was standing under the changing weather, soon the rain came in heavily and the guy still stood there, I was scooting to the middle of the canopy because even been at the edge I wasn't safe.There stood a guy separate from the rest of us he was standing gallant under the changing weather, soon the rain came in heavily and the guy still stood there, I was scooting to the middle of the canopy because even the edge where I stood  wasn't safe.</p>
              <p>Someone came to tap me asked me to help keep his phone away from the rain which I did, I kept it neatly tucked in my handbag , later doro told me that when he saw me dancing into the service his first thoughts were "I'd like to be with someone like this".</p>
              <p>We didn’t cross paths again until the end of the service. Suddenly, Doro remembered his phone wasn’t with him. He started looking around for the girl he had handed it to, I walked up to him and returned it because I was watching him look for me. I still remember his gratitude; he kept repeating, “Thank you so much, thank you so much.” That was the first time he truly saw me, and as he would later confess, I never left his heart after that moment.</p>
              <p>Two months passed before Doro decided to speak to me. He saw me during an invasion evangelism, and he always jokes that I was dressed in white on white that day. Seeing me again stirred something in him, and he sought counsel from a friend, confessing that he liked me and wanted to talk to me. His friend encouraged him to start a conversation, but Doro said he felt strongly in his spirit to first speak to my pastor about his intentions for marriage.</p>
              <p>The following week, after an evening meeting, he saw my pastor. While waiting, he spotted me at a distance, quickly took a picture, and showed it to my pastor because he didn’t even know my name.</p>
              <p>That same day, my pastor called me. He said, “A young man came to me today. He said he likes you and wants to marry you.” I laughed and told him I’d stop by on Tuesday so he could show me the picture of the young man. From Friday to Tuesday, my mind ran through a hundred possible subjects, and Doro wasn’t even on the list!</p>
              <p>When I finally saw the picture and realized it was him, I felt immense gratitude to God. My heart accepted him instantly. I asked my pastor to send my number to him.</p>
              <p>The next day, he called, and we agreed to meet. I visited his shop to see the man I was about to love wholeheartedly in his own space. We sat and talked for an hour. He spoke with so much sincerity about why he wanted to be with me.</p>
              <p>And that, right there, is how we met. The rest, as they say, is history but for us, it’s more than history. It’s a love story written by God Himself.</p>
